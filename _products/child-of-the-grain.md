In the peaceful farming village of Eden’s Rest, the soil never fails and the fields never die. Travelers are welcomed with warmth, laughter, and endless feasts — yet every harvest hides a secret. Beneath the golden wheat lies a pact older than memory, one that demands life in exchange for abundance.

As your party arrives for the Harvest Festival, they’ll uncover whispers of missing children, ancient rites, and the pulsing heart that feeds the world itself. Every choice carries weight — mercy or survival, balance or ruin.

Children of the Grain is a slow-burn folk horror one-shot for 5e, blending moral choice, rural superstition, and creeping dread. Perfect as a standalone session or campaign prelude where every kindness has a cost, and every harvest leaves a scar.
