- **Tone:** Fallen heroism • Moral decay • Hellish intrigue
- **Level:** 2–13 (official campaign)
- **Length:** Long-term campaign (multiple arcs)
- **Players Needed:** 3–5 to begin

> The holy city of Elturel has fallen—dragged screaming into the first layer of Hell.
> Baldur’s Gate teeters on the brink of the same damnation, and the line between hero and monster blurs with every desperate choice.
> Can you save a city that may not deserve salvation?

**What to Expect**
- Heavy narrative and moral decision-making
- Deadly combat with infernal enemies
- Deals, corruption, and redemption
- A journey from the streets of Baldur’s Gate to the fires of Avernus itself

**Player Guidance**
- Create a character grounded in flawed ideals and inner conflict.
- This is a story about what you’re willing to sacrifice to do what’s right—or what you call “right.”
- Every choice leaves a mark, and Hell remembers all debts.
- Ideal backgrounds: Acolyte, Soldier, Criminal, or Guild Artisan
- Alignment flexibility encouraged, but cooperation is essential
